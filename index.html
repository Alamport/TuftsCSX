			<p>We're a group of students interested in promoting Computer Science education and fostering community within the department here at Tufts. </p>
			<p>We hold tech-talks and meetings once a week in Halligan Hall, and we'd love to meet you. Feel free to <a href="https://www.eecs.tufts.edu/mailman/listinfo/acm">subscribe to our e-list</a> and check out our <a href="https://www.facebook.com/TuftsCSX">facebook page</a>.</p> 
			<p>You can also get to know the <a href="">executive board</a> or <a href="mailto:acmexecs@elist.tufts.edu">send us an email</a>. You can also find a list of <a href="">projects</a> here as well as a list of <a href="">past events</a>. </p>

			<p>The Computer Science Exchange evolved out of Tufts' ACM (Association for Computing Machinery). We're an independent, student-run organization inspired by the idea of unlocking the shared potential of computer science students who wouldn't otherwise share ideas and skills. </p>
			<p>We believe that each year has something to learn from the others, and that each student stands to learn from his or her classmates, and we provide the opportunity and the context for that intellectual exchange to occur. We bring in student speakers to share their passions and areas of expertise with us, as well as teachers, faculty, and guest lecturers from both academia and industry. </p>
