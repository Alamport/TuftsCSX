The Computer Science Exchange evolved out of Tufts' ACM (Association for Computing Machinery). We're an independent, student-run organization inspired by the idea of unlocking the shared potential of computer science students who wouldn't otherwise share ideas and skills. 

We believe that each year has something to learn from the others, and that each students stands to learn from his or her classmates, and we provide the opportunity and the context for that intellectual exchange to occur. We bring in student speakers to share their passions and areas of expertise with us, as well as teachers, faculty, and guest lecturers from both academia and industry. 

We also strive to present to students the sort of practical programming skills they may not encounter in the classroom, but will need to be successful in a work environment.
